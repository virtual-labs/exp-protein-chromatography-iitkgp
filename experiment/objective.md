## Objective

Affinity chromatography is a biophysical technique that exploits the unique biological function or the chemical structure of a biomolecule such that it specifically binds to an immobilized ligand reversibly and can be separated from a mixture of several biomolecules. This chromatographic technique helps to achieve the following.

1. **High specificity of purification:** Selectively purify the target protein with high specificity while minimizing contamination from other proteins.
2. **High purity:** Obtain a highly pure target protein.
3. **Retention of Bioactivity:** Maintain the structural and functional integrity of the protein.
4. **Efficient Yield:** Maximize the recovery of the target protein.
5. **Rapid Purification:** Achieve fast and efficient separation with fewer purification steps.
